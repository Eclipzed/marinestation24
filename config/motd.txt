Our group has been inspired by Baystation 12. Most of the admins are current ARMA 2/3 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) members, and are pretty cool dudes.
We only have one core rule, here: Be Excellent to each other (OOC). Stay appropriate in-character, no powergamey, metagamey, or douchey behaviour will be tolerated. This is your first and only warning. We do not have forums or other methods of out-of-game contact. If you receive punitive action, address it at an appropriate time if you feel it was unjust.

<h1>Man up and deal with it.</h1>
