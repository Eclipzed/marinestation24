Our group has been inspired by Baystation 12. Most of the admins are current ARMA 2/3 24th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) members, and are pretty cool dudes.
<br>
<strong>It is important to note:</strong> Despite our origins, MS24 itself does not endorse military-style roleplay. We're here to enjoy SS13.
<br>
We only have one core rule, here: Be Excellent to each other (OOC). Stay appropriate in-character, no powergamey, metagamey, or douchey behaviour will be tolerated. This is your first and only warning. We do not have forums or other methods of out-of-game contact. If you receive punitive action, address it at an appropriate time if you feel it was unjust.
<br>
In general, if you follow the guidelines <strong><a href="http://baystation12.net/wiki/index.php?title=Rules">HERE</a></strong>, everything will be just grand. You may certainly discuss and request help from the admins. We love feedback, but not demands.

<h2>Man up and deal with it.</h2>
